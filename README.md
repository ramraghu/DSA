# Data Structurs and Algorithms in Python

Data Structures:
-----------------
When a program is dealing with data, then how it will organize it in main memory is defined by data structure. 

Physical Data Structures : Array & Linked List
Logical Data Structures : Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Hashing 

Memory Management : 
Memory is a colleciton of small addressable units called bytes 
8 bits - 1 byte

Code Section : Program is stored here 
Stack : Stack frame or activation record | Used for Static memory allocation 
Heap : | Used for dynamic memory allocation

Physical and Logical DataStrucutures : 

Physical Data-Structures : 

Array : 
	Collection of continuous memory locations
	Have fixed size 
	Can be created either in stack or heap 
	Used when max number of elements are known/defined. 
	
Linked-Lists : 
	Collection Nodes 
	Each node contains a data-element and a link to next node 
	Has variable length 
	Always created in a heap 

Logical Data-Structures :
