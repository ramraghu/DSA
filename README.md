# Data Structurs and Algorithms in Python

Data Structures:
-----------------
When a program is dealing with data, then how it will organize it in main memory is defined by data structure. 

Physical Data Structures : Array & Linked List
Logical Data Structures : Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Hashing 

Memory Management : 
Memory is a colleciton of small addressable units called bytes 
8 bits - 1 byte

Code Section : Program is stored here 
Stack : Stack frame or activation record | Used for Static memory allocation 
Heap : | Used for dynamic memory allocation
